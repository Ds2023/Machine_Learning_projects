# Hospitality_employees forecasting

## Problem statement: 

The hospitality industry is a major economic driver in many states and countries. In the United States, for example, the hospitality industry employs over 17 million people and generates over $800 billion in annual revenue. However, the hospitality industry is also highly cyclical, with demand for labor fluctuating with seasonal trends and economic conditions. This can make it difficult for hospitality businesses to accurately forecast their staffing needs, which can lead to either overstaffing or understaffing.

## Importance of forecasting:

- Improved operational efficiency
- Better customer service
- Reduced risk of labor shortages 
- Improved planning for future growth 
 
## Requirements

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
